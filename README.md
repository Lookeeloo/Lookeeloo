# Lookeeloo
**UPDATE PER 09/12/2023: Lookeeloo is now open source for anyone to view!**

Lookeeloo is a platform where you can watch videos (and you will be able to upload soon!). It has **ABSOLUTELY ZERO CENSORSHIP**, making any kind of videos easy to be watched by everyone.

## Where did the idea of Lookeeloo starts?
zeankun.dev (known today on GitHub as `SerialDesignatorN`) started to make the very early builds of Lookeeloo in early 2021 (as early as April 2021!). Years of project scraping, we are here, but instead of becoming like a "sole Netflix clone", we also mashed up the elements of Netflix, Youtube and 4chan all combined!

## Installation
Go figure it out yourself.
